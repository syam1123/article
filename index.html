					Some of you may be shocked at the idea that poorer students aren't getting a fair shot, because it seems like college campuses are just chock-full of special treatment for them: They got the FAFSA applications, Pell Grants, Work Study opportunities, and all kinds of need-based scholarships. The problem is that a lot of poorer students get choked out of these opportunities during the application phase -- not by being denied admission but by being hit with "admit-deny."

					"But all the college applications say they're 'need-blind'!" Sure, and that pudding container says "instant," but I don't have any pudding when I open it up, do I? Turns out "need-blind" is sort of a myth. Colleges can work that way only if they have endless financial resources, and there aren't too many colleges like that.
